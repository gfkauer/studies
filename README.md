Studies
==
This repository will agroup all my repositories used to learn or pratice anything.
This will be my first repo documented only in english, and I know how bad I write in English.

I will try to use dev containers to remove the instalation process along the way. To learn more about this you can acess this [documentation][1].
And to watch a fast setup tutorial watch this [video][2]. In the furute I will add this repo with my notes about this process.
